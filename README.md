# Archipelago Cortex

Cortex is a caching GraphQL API that provides an abstraction layer for interacting with modern natural language AI models. Itâ€™s extensible, open-sourced, and model-agnostic and provides a structured interface to the largely unstructured world of AI prompting.

## Why build Cortex?

Querying modern NL AI models (e.g. GPT-3) can be costly and cumbersome. Executing queries against large models like Davinci is very resource intensive and can result in excessive resource usage and cloud service charges. Additionally, querying can be complicated as most models require very specific formatting for consistent results and the returns are often free-form text without proper validation or formatting. Cortex solves these problems by providing a simple and extensible package for querying NL AI models.

## Features

- Abstraction of common NL AI tasks from the underlying models
- Summarization
- Entity extraction
- Topic classification
- Headline generation
- Translation
- Rewrites
- Completion
- Sentiment analysis
- Bias analysis
- Spelling and grammar correction
- Style guide rule application
- Easily configurable chunking and prompting strategies per task and per model using a simple prompt definition format
- Parallelization of chunked requests to the model layer for response acceleration
- Encapsulation of prompting and parsing for structured return data
- Generation of lists as proper data structures instead of text blocks
- Structured return blocks with properties
- Caching of often-repeated queries to avoid excess model querying
- Insulation against emerging prompt-specific security concerns
- Structured analytics and reporting on AI API call frequency, cost, cache hit rate, etc.

## Getting Started

To use Cortex, simply install the package and initialize a Cortex instance with your desired NL AI model. Then, use the provided GraphQL schema to make queries and receive structured data in return.
